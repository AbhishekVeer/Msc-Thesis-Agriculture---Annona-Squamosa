**Abstract:**

The present investigations entitled “Studies on flowering behaviour,
reproductive biology and fruit set of sugar apple (Annona squamosa L.) in eastern
coastal region” was conducted at CHES (IIHR-ICAR), Bhubaneswar in 2019. Studies
were conducted during April, May, June and July in two varieties namely Arka Neelachal
Vikram and Red Sitaphal. Flowering behaviour was studied on the basis of variation in
flowering intensity during April to July and maximum flower production was observed in
May followed by April in both the varieties. Pollen viability was assessed by
acetocarmine, lugol’s solution, safranin and aniline blue stain and among them lugol’s
solution was found to be better due to high pollen staining capacity. The efficacy of pollen
staining dyes was correlated with pollen germinability. Higher pollen viability % implied
higher germination % and subsequent higher fruit set per cent in July. Maximum pollen
viability was observed in July with 91.01% and 85.32% in Red Sitaphal and Arka
Neelachal Vikram, respectively. Pollen germination medium was also optimized with
sucrose (10%), boron (400ppm) and calcium (200 ppm). Maximum pollen germination
was recorded in July with 64.10% in Red Sitaphal and 54.52% in Arka Neelachal Vikram,
whereas it was minimum in April. Pollen production capacity (pollen /flower) was highest
in the month of July in Arka Neelachal Vikram (41093.54) and Red Sitaphal (43628.33).
Mean stigma receptivity was also highest in the month of July which was 44.50% in Arka
Neelachal Vikram and 47.50% in Red Sitaphal. All of the above parameters tested were
found to be positively correlated with fruit set. Maximum mean fruit set was obtained in
Red Sitaphal in July (8.17%) followed by Arka Neelachal Vikram in July (7.89%).
Relative humidity and average rainfall were found to be positively correlated with pollen
production, pollen viability, pollen germination, stigma receptivity and fruit set, whereas
temperature was negatively correlated.

The present investigation gave an indication that weather parameters play vital
role in pollen production, pollen viability, germinability, stigma receptivity and in fruit set
of sugar apple (A.squamosa) under eastern coastal Odisha condition. Mild temperature
with high humidity was conducive for better fruit set in Annona squamosa.
